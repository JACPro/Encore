# Encore

## Introduction
Encore is an educational history game that aims to bridge the gap between games as a form of entertainment and as a medium for education. I created it as part of my dissertation in my final year at the University of Sussex.

## Story

You play as Alex; a high school student that's failing his classes and at risk of having to retake the year unless you pass your history assignment about the colonisation of Manhattan.
After falling asleep in class, you awake to find yourself in America in 1626. You run into Dutch Colonist Peter Minuit, who is attempting to purchase Manhattan from the local Canarsee tribe. Unforunately, communication is difficult and he's struggling to settle the deal. He enlists you to help him as an intermediary to convince the Canarsee leader Chief Seyseys to trade.

The game features branching dialogue and a quest system and has been made as historically accurate as possible.


## Documentation

In creating this project, I utilised knowledge gained through the software engineering module I studied in my second year, and proceeded through the steps of the software development life cycle in turn. I retained all documents I produced through each of the analysis, design, production, testing, and evaluation stages of this project, and compiled them into a final report.
